# theCode

Exploring an AI-native development workflow where the human operates as product owner and strategic decision-maker, while AI agents handle autonomous execution.

## What This Is

A framework for restructuring the human-AI collaboration in software development. The core insight: as model capability increases, the bottleneck shifts from "can AI do the work" to "can the human manage the cognitive overhead of coordinating AI work." This project captures the thinking and provides a validation path.

## Docs

- [Summary](docs/summary.md) — Core thesis, workflow phases, operating principles
- [Validation SOP](docs/validation-sop.md) — Step-by-step process to test this workflow on real projects

## Status

Framework design phase. Next step: validate on a real business project using the SOP.
